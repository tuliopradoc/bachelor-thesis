The thesis at hand aims to study the de Rham cohomology of smooth surfaces and
present a proof of a duality result, dating from 1895, due to H. Poincaré, namely, the
Poincaré Duality Theorem. We also look into some applications of such duality involving
the Euler-Poincaré characteristic and the signature of compact surfaces, and discuss
its connections to the Hodge decomposition theorem. In order to do so, we develop some
preliminary tools by providing an overview of basic concepts in the language of categories
and functors, homological algebra and differential forms on surfaces in Euclidean spaces.
